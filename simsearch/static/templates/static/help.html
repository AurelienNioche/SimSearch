<h1>Help</h1>

<h2>Using similarity search</h2>
<p>Similarity search is designed to help you find a kanji you don't know, by
using a similar one as a query. For example, suppose you ran into the kanji
<span lang="ja">動</span>, which you hadn't seen before. It looks a lot like
one you do know, <span lang="ja">働</span> from <span>働く</span>
<em>hataraku</em> "to work". So, you enter <span lang="ja">働</span> as query,
and can quickly find the unknown kanji.</p>

<p>If you enter a query, and can't immediately see the kanji you're looking
for, you should click on the next closest match. By doing this a few times, you should hopefully find the kanji you're looking for.</p>

<p>Whilst this form of search is designed for single-kanji queries, you can
also use it for words by querying any of the kanji in the word. When you find
your target, its translation page provides single-click queries to word-level
dictionaries.</p>

<h2>Other good dictionaries</h2>

<p>Whilst searching this way can be fun, it's not appropriate all the time.
You might not know any similar kanji to the one you're trying to find, or you
might just have a difficult one. The best strategy in general is to have
a number of dictionaries you can use, and to pick the best one for the job. We
recommend:</p>
